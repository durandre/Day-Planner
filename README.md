# Day-Planner
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

I created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time, fontawesome, and bootstrap.
